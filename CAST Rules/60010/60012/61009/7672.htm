<h5>Unified Status</h5>

<h5>XXL Status</h5>

<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>5</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>For robustness and transferability reasons, it is better to avoid using the EXIT statement in includes. If a program references such an include and if developers did not see the EXIT statements, then blocks could be terminated unexpectedly or the program could stop prematurely.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This metric retrieves all include files containing EXIT statements. The metric does not take into account EXIT used inside a loop.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Use EXIT statements in programs that call the include and remove these statements from include. It could be better to use return codes and to let the calling code managing the exit.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each ABAP Include with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - The number of violation patterns</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of ABAP Includes</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
