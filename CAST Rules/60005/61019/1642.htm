<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Having complex queries in Functions can cause performance problems. The most expensive step in the SQL preparation process is the generation of the execution plan, particularly when dealing with a query with multiple joins. When Oracle evaluates table join orders, it must consider every possible
combination of tables. For example, a six-way table join has 720 (permutations of 6, or 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720) possible ways that the tables can be joined together. This permutation issue becomes even more pronounced when you have more than 10 joined tables in a query: For a 15-way table
join, there are over one trillion (1,307,674,368,000 to be exact) possible query permutations that must be evaluated. Evaluation is dependend of the following Oracle configuration: optimizer_search_limit and optimizer_max_permutations. Thus the same query can have a different behavior depending on
database configuration and joins with many queries are likely to be inefficient as the optimizer will likely stop computing permutations before reaching the best solution.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Avoid Functions / Procedures with queries on more than 4 Tables. Queries with more than 4 Tables is considered complex. Changing the threshold value requires Metric Assistant configuration update. Note: &quot;Functions &amp; Procedures&quot; is a generic name that include different types of
objects: - function - stored procedure - trigger (special stored procedure fired by event) - package function - package procedure</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Thes best solution is to review the query to reduce the number of involved Tables. It is alwo possible to use the &quot;odered hint&quot;.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all Functions / Procedures with queries on too many Tables. It provides the following information: Function / Procedure full name, number of Tables</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>1642</p>
