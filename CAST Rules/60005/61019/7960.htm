<h4>Avoid looping chain of synonyms in PL/SQL context</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Forms, PL/SQL</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>1</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Presence of a looping chain of synonyms will generate error at execution time when accessed. Even if a looping chain of synonyms is authorized at creation time, the execution time will generate &quot;ORA-01775 looping chain of synonyms&quot; error</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This metric retrieves synonyms that are part of a looping chain of synonym. Indeed through a series of CREATE synonym statements, a synonym could be defined and in fact refer to itself</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Change at least one synonym definition to cut the circular list</p>
<h5>Reference</h5>
<p>Oracle documentation, for example</p>
<h5>Sample</h5>
<pre>
For example, the following definitions are circular:

SQL&gt; create synonym s1 for s2;
Synonym created.
SQL&gt; create synonym s2 for s3;
Synonym created.
SQL&gt; create synonym s3 for s4;
Synonym created.
SQL&gt; create synonym s4 for s1;
Synonym created.
</pre>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all the ordered looping chain of synonyms : It provides the following information: the ordered list of each synonym that is part of the looping chain. The name of each synonym that is part of the full name,</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>The total procedure counts the number of synonyms that is part of the analyzed source code</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7960</p>
