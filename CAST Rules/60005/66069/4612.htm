<h4>Avoid using native Methods (JNI)</h4>

<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>JNI is one of the most serious cause of application server crash that can be due for example to buffer overflow. Even if your code works on a plateform, it doesn&#39;t mean that it will work on other plateform because the internals of JVMs differ. In case of crash, your JVM suplier&#39;s support
will probably ask you to remove these calls before investigating your issue. Also, for portability purposes, native Methods should not be used. Native Methods could be compared to Interfaces to encapsulate calls to C Methods and Functions. Doing so relies on having the appropriate environment setup
at the operating system level.</p>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>List all artifacts that call a native method except native methods contained in the libraries defined by the threshold parameter. The threshold is a parameter and can be changed at will with libraries that you consider to be safe.</p>
