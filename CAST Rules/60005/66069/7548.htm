<h4>Never use incompatible statements with the CICS environment</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Cobol</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>Yes</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>9</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>The CICS environment forbids some Cobol statements concerning I/O operations and program termination. The use of these statements can cause problems in production and can crash applications.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rule searches for Cobol programs running under the CICS environment containing statements that are not permitted. These statements are the following: - ACCEPT - ENTRY - DISPLAY - FD and SD - SELECT &lt;file&gt; ASSIGN TO - OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, REWRITE, DELETE - MERGE, SORT - START -
STOP The following exception is taken into account: some batch programs can contain EXEC CICS commands in order to run CICS utilities (DFH*). If these types of programs do not execute other commands, then they will not be considered as violating the rule.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>These statements must be removed from programs running under the CICS environment. Files can be accessed by using specific macros provided with CICS.</p>

<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all CICS programs containing incompatible statements. It provides the following information: - Cobol Program Full Name - Number of violations It also provides bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code: - Incompatible Cobol statement</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of Cobol Programs running under the CICS</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7548</p>
