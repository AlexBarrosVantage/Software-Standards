<h4>Avoid using COMPUTE statement for elementary arithmetic operation</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Cobol</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>4</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>COMPUTE is a performance consuming statement and should be used to perform complex arithmetic operations. Simple operation should be performed by using ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY and DIVIDE statements that are more efficient and more easy to understand.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rule searches for Cobol programs using the COMPUTE statement for elementary arithmetic operation. Expressions with only one binary operator (+, -, *, /) are taken into account. Expressions based on the exponentiation operator (&#39;**&#39;) are not considered as violating the rule.
Expression with only one operand (with or without an unary operator) are taken into account. Example: - A = B - A = -1 - A = 0</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Replace COMPUTE statements used for only one arithmetic operation by ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY or DIVIDE statements.</p>
<h5>Reference</h5>
<p>IBM Enterprise Cobol - Programming Guide</p>
<h5>Sample</h5>
<pre>
COMPUTE A = A + 1
COMPUTE D = B / C
COMPUTE E = 4
</pre>
<h5>Remediation sample</h5>
<pre>
ADD 1 TO A
DIVIDE B BY C GIVING D
MOVE 4 TO E
</pre>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - The number of violation patterns - Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code: - COMPUTE statement</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of Cobol Programs</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7754</p>
