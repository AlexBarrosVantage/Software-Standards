<h4>Class members should be declared as Private</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>ABAP</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>6</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>This is one of the main benefit and principle of Object-Oriented design and coding: Encapsulation. If direct access to object members is allowed through Public members, there is a significant increase of the cost and risk of changes as well as an increase of security risks. However, a public
member can be flagged with the READ-ONLY attribute in order to avoid external modification.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rule searches for class members that are not declared as Private. The following situations are excluded from the list of violations: - Protected members belonging to a class having sub-classes - Public members declared with the addition READ-ONLY - Constants</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>General way is to implement methods to access Data Members. However, if the member is mainly read by external methods, then you can use the READ-ONLY attribute.</p>

CLASS table_content DEFINITION.
  PUBLIC SECTION.
     METHODS: calc_spfli,
                       calc__sflight.
     DATA: wa_spfli TYPE spfli,
                 wa_sflight TYPE sflight.
                 wa_disp TYPE i.

                         calc__sflight,
* Define accessors to members
                         get_spfli,
                         get_sflight.
     DATA: wa_disp TYPE i read-only.
  PRIVATE SECTION.
     DATA: wa_spfli TYPE spfli,
                 wa_sflight TYPE sflight.
ENDCLASS

<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each ABAP Class Member with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - The Class Member visibility</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of ABAP Members</p>
