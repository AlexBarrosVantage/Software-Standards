<h4>Avoid unreferenced Classes</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>

<h5>Unified Status</h5>

<h5>XXL Status</h5>

<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>

<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>4</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Unreferenced code may be the symptom of Dead Code. Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance. Warning: Unreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis) and / or can
be the symptom of use of polymorphism. The intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>All Classes should be referenced. An unreferenced Class is a class 1- which is not referenced from other classes and 2- where none of its members is referenced from other members of other classes. 3- a class that has no static main method As of today, this excludes references from other
languages (for instance, JSP calling static members. This case will be handled in the future).</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Check if the Class is truly unnecessary. Remove Classes that are not used.</p>
