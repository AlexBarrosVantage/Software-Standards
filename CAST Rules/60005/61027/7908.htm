<h4>Avoid unreferenced Methods</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>.Net, ABAP, C#, C++, JEE, Visual Basic</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>Unified</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>4</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Unreferenced code may be the symptom of Dead Code. Dead Code must be avoided as it makes source code less readable and increases the cost of the software maintenance. Warning: Unreferenced code can also be the symptoms of missing code (code not included in the source code analysis) and / or can
be the symptom of use of polymorphism. The intensive use of polymorphism can make the application easier to change but much more difficult to test, debug and stabilize.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Reports all methods and constructors that are not referenced except main, getter and setter. A threshold parameter permit to include getter and setter methods. NOTE: * a method/constructor is considered as unreferenced when it is never called and the method doesn&#39;t override a method of a
class or doesn&#39;t implement a method of an interface. * For .net, getter and setter (of properties and indexer) are included * For J2EE, getter and setter methods are not included by default because usually these methods are automatically created from IDE and also they can be involved through
dynamic mechanism like reflection.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Check if the Method is truly unnecessary. Remove Methods that are not used.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all unreferenced Methods. It provides the following information: Method full name</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Total number of methods</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7908</p>
