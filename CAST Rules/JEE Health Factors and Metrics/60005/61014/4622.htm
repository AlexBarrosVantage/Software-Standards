<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>

<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>6</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>As the name suggests, code in a finally block is always executed last, after all other code in a corresponding try-catch block has been executed. It often involves freeing or releasing shared resources such as sockets, CORBA objects, database connections, files, and performing other clean-up
operations. Empty finally blocks are of no use and may indicate that a particular processing that must always occur prior to completing a method or block of code in a method has not been written and thus can lead to memory or resources leaks. Moreover, an empty finally block prevents the JIT from
optimizing the code block.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This Quality Rule finds all empty finally blocks or finally blocks that only contain comments.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all Methods with an empty Finally block. It provides the following information: Method full name</p>
