<h4>Avoid Too Many Copy Pasted Artifacts</h4>

<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>

<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>

<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>A program with a lot of duplication is hard to change. It might be required to change every copy of a copy/pasted code while it is very difficult to locate these copy/pasted code elements. Copy-and-paste is not always bad for a quick urgent &quot;hack&quot;, but it is always a very dangerous
practice in the long run.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This metric measures the ratio between the number of duplicated, copy/pasted artifacts and the total number of artifacts. Copy / Paste detection is based on statistical detection methods. The statistical methods used compute a similarity metric between all artifacts. Artifacts are reported as
copy / pasted when the similarity is higher than 90% (see metric parameter SIMILARITY). Like any statistical method, the detection algorithms require a well sized sample in order to provide significant results: testing these algorithms with a couple of classes will not do the job, a real life
application&#39;s source code is required to yield usable results. The minimal size required stands at around 5000 lines of code. Below such a size, the algorithms detect the full list of exact copies for the copy/paste code detection but slightly modified copy/paste code will not always be
detected. Also, for optimal efficiency, the copy/pasted code detection is enabled only for artifacts larger than 10 lines of code (methods, functions, procedures, triggers, programs...).</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Artifacts larger than 10 lines of code ( default value of the CODELINE parameter )</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
