<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>A foreign key is an integral part of a relational database design and contributes to the database&#39;s consistency. The use of Foreign Keys between Tables must be applied to manage referential integrity only. When one table has a foreign key to another table, the concept of referential
integrity states that you may not add a record to the table that contains the foreign key unless there is a corresponding record in the linked table. It also includes the techniques known as cascading update and cascading delete, which ensure that changes made to the linked table are reflected in
the primary table. This avoids redundant data entry and thus maintains data integrity.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This diag is a clone of the old diag called &quot;Avoid tables not involved in a Foreign key&quot; listing all tables not involved in a Foreign Key (FK). The use of Foreign Keys between Tables must be applied to manage referential integrity only.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Add the Foreign Key if necessary. Using a foreign key ensures that the integrity of the data across tables is maintained.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all tables not involved in a Foreign Key It provides the following information: - Table name</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>total is number of tables</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7814</p>
