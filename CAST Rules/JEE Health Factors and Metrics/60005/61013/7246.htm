<h4>Avoid Packages with High Efferent Coupling (CE)</h4>

<h5>XXL Status</h5>

<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>4</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Excessive coupling is detrimental to modular design since classes are not independent. A large efferent coupling indicates that a class is unfocussed and may also indicate that it is unstable, since it depends on the stability of all the types to which it is coupled. This prevents reuse since a
high coupling possibly indicates a package is poorly designed and difficult to understand/maintain. Extracting classes from the original class so the class is decomposed into smaller classes can reduce efferent coupling, this improves modularity and promotes encapsulation.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>CE (also known as Outgoing Dependencies or the Number of Types outside a Package that Types of the Package Depend on) indicates the number of other packages that classes and interfaces in the analyzed package depend upon. This is an indicator of the package&#39;s independence. The threshold
contains the maximum efferent coupling.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report all classes ( and interfaces ) of a package with a high efferent Coupling. It provides the following information: - Class (Or Interface) - CE</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
