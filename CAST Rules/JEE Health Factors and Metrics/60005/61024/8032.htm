<h4>Avoid using a break statement in &#39;for&#39; loops</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>C Language, C#, C++, JEE</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>6</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>A &#39;for&#39; loop must be straightforward to read. Using too many &#39;break&#39; statements in &#39;for&#39; loops makes them more difficult to read.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rule searches for functions that contain a &#39;break&#39; statement in a &#39;for&#39; loop. &#39;break&#39; statements located in nested loops will also be reported as a violation to this rule. Note: For C#, foreach statements are not considered because there is no stop condition in the
loop definition. Break statements located in nested loops will also be reported as a violation to this rule.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Try to remove the &#39;break&#39; statements from the loop and to manage the end-of-loop within the loop condition part.</p>
<h5>Sample</h5>
<pre>
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) 
{        
    if (true) 
    {
        break;   // Violation
    }
    // ...
}
</pre>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each Function with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - Number of violation patterns - Bookmarks for violation patterns found in the source code: - &#39;break&#39; statement</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of functions that contain at least one &#39;for&#39; loop</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>8032</p>
