<h4>Avoid recursive Triggers</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Microsoft T-SQL, SQL Server, Sybase T-SQL</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>4</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Recursive calls can be unpredictable with regard to consumption of resources, especially memory. Under certain condition, a function or procedure using a recursive call can keep calling itself and as each call consumes memory, the entire application runs out of memory. Recursive calls are known
to be difficult to test for because the termination condition and thus the resource consumption might be dependent on the data used for the test. For all these reasons, it is often forbidden and limited to academic usage rather than for mission-critical systems. Because the flip side is complexity,
such a trade-off should be carefully chosen by architects or senior developers, balancing cost with reliability and in all cases the conditions under which it is used should be reviewed in details. Triggers recursivity can be disabled by configuration of the database server (setting the Allow
nested triggers option off).</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Triggers should not modify data in the Table that has triggered them, in the same way as they where triggered in the first place.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Review the design of the Triggers</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all recursive Triggers It provides the following information: Trigger Full Name</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>4056</p>
