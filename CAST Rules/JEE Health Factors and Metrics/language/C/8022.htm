<h4>Avoid hiding attributes</h4>
<hr>

<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>Unified</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>6</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Hiding data members is not good Object-Oriented practice. It is a redefinition of an instance or class variable and it makes the relationship between the base class and the derived class unclear. It is also likely to be an unintended mistake.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rule searches for classes that override data members in the inheritance tree. A data member &lt;member&gt; of class &lt;BaseClass&gt; is overridden in a derived class &lt;DerivedClass&gt; if &lt;DerivedClass&gt; contains an identical declaration of &lt;member&gt; (i.e. same name (type can
be different)). A list of data member name exceptions can be provided to manage specific cases where the field is generated or required to be used by a specific framework.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>The solution depends on the design: - use the inherited member and remove the member declaration in the child class - rename the member of the child class</p>
<h5>Sample</h5>
<pre>
Java Sample:
public class SampleBase {
     protected long a = 4;
 }
 
 public class Sample extends SampleBase {
    protected int a = 5;  // VIOLATION
 }

C++ Sample:
class BaseClass 
{
protected: 
    long a;
};
 
class DerivedClass : BaseClass 
{
protected: 
    int a;  // VIOLATION
 };
</pre>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each overridden data member with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - Hidden attribute full name</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of class data members</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>8022</p>
