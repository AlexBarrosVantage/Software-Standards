<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>8</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>The effort and time for diagnosis of deficiencies or causes of failures, or for identification of parts to be modified is directly related to the number of execution paths, i.e. the complexity of the control flow. Analyzability declines with increasing Cyclomatic Complexity. Each modification
must be correct for all execution paths. Cyclomatic Complexity computes the number of the linearly independent paths, a lower bound of all execution paths ignoring multiple iterations. Changeability declines with increasing Cyclomatic Complexity. Complete testing requires coverage of all execution
paths. Cyclomatic Complexity computes the number of the linearly independent paths, a lower bound of all execution paths ignoring multiple iterations. Testability declines with increasing Cyclomatic Complexity.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Avoid Artifacts with High Cyclomatic Complexity (CC &gt; 20). Complex Artifacts are difficult to maintain. Keeping Artifacts small and simple ensures an good readability of the code. The threshold level is a parameter that can be changed at will.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Review the design of the Artifact to reduce number of independent paths. E.g.: Reduce the number of conditional statements.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each ABAP Artifact with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - The Cyclomatic complexity</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of ABAP Artifacts</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7112</p>
