<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>

<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>The run-time type checking is a time expensive operation and as such should be avoided within loops. In a more general matter, the use of is operator, run-time type checking might indicate a misuse of Object Oriented programming. In deed, it is always recommended to design classes and interfaces
so client code do not need to use &#39;is&#39; operator and down-casting. The recommended way is to prefer polymorphism over &#39;is&#39; operator and down-casting.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>All methods that use &quot;is&quot; operator inside a loop will be reported.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Prefer polymorphism over &#39;is&#39; operator and down-casting. It is always recommended to design classes and interfaces so client code do not need to use &#39;is&#39; operator and down-casting. The recommended way is to prefer polymorphism over &#39;is&#39; operator and down-casting.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all methods that use the &#39;is&#39; operator String inside loops. It provides the following information: Method full name</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Total number of methods</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
