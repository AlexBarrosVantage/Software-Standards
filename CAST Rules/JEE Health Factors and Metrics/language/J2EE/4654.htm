<h4>Avoid throwing an exception of type Exception (JEE)</h4>

<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>

<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>8</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Whenever a method throws an exception of type Exception, it prevents its callers from doing the specific recovery process that is needed and as a consequence this will threaten both application robustness and security. For example, each exception related to resource allocation whose catch does
not explicitly release the resource might create a &quot;resource leak&quot;. When such a leak happens on a limited set of available resources, such as a database connection, the application can then become unusable because no resources can be allocated any more. The application also becomes
difficult to support and run in production as root-cause analysis is made more difficult. The support teams might not even be aware that something went wrong (by catching Exception, RuntimeException might not be visible any more).</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>The exception Exception should never been thrown. Always Subclass Exception and throw the Subclassed Classes.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>The method must throw a Subclass of the generic Exception to provide valuable information about the exception that occurred in order to help programmers calling this method to write the appropriate recovery or error management code.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
