<h4>Avoid Fields in Servlet Classes that are not final static</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>JEE</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>Yes</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>8</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Servlets must be programmed in a thread-safe manner, because the controller will share the same instance for multiple simultaneous requests. In addition to the servlet&#39;s threading model, if your intention is to store request-specific state and if your container provides clustering
facilities, there&#39;s no guarantee that the same servlet instance will receive all the requests (from one user or all users) in a Web application. The use of non static final fields within a Servlet creates a security breach as this object is shared among multiple sessions and thus can lead to
confidential data leaks.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Find all non final static fields that belong to Servlets. All Classes that extend HttpServlet at any level are considered as Servlets.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Review the Class design. Store global information in HttpSession, or use stateful session beans that are specifically targeted for this purpose. For temporary storage in a Servlet use local variables that are scoped within the doGet or doPost methods (or the service method).</p>

<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all non final static fields that belong to Servlet classes. It provides the following information: - Field full name</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of fields of all classes that extend HttpServlet at any level</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7152</p>
