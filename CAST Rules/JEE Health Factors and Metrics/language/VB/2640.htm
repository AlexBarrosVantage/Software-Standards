<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Changing a class requires prior understanding, which, in turn, is more complicated for classes with many methods. Classes that are deep down in the classes hierarchy potentially inherit many methods from super-classes. Moreover, the definitions of inherited methods are not local to the class
making it even harder to understand it. Complete testing requires coverage of all execution paths. The number of possible execution paths of a class increases with the number of methods and their control flow complexity. Classes that are deep down in the classes hierarchy potentially inherit many
methods from super-classes. Due to late binding, super-class methods need to be tested again in the sub-class context. This makes it potentially harder to test classes deep down in the classes hierarchy. Technical or framework classes which are evolving and will not be changed often should not be
concerned by this rule.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Avoid Classes with a High Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT greater than X+1). This means that the inheritance tree should have at most X levels. Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT) is the maximum length of a path from a class to a root class in the inheritance structure of a system. DIT measures how
many super-classes can affect a class.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Review the design of the Class hierarchy</p>

<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all Classes with a Depth of Inheritance Tree greater than X+1 It provides the following information: Class full name, DIT</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
