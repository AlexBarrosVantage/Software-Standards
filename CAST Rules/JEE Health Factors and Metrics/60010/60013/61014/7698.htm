<h4>Files should be declared with a FILE-STATUS</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Cobol</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>8</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>A number of errors can occur that result from file input-output that programmer may wish to be able to deal with in order to avoid unexpected program termination. Run time errors can arise quite easily from a file not being available to open, or if present the data is corrupted. Furthermore,
what if there is no more disk space available or not enough space has been allocated to allow for addition of new data. Other errors, such as attempting to close a file that isn&#39;t open, or to read a file opened for output only, may well derive from logical errors (that is, programming mistakes)
but can be dealt with nonetheless when debugging. These kinds of errors will normally result in termination of the program run, whereas using File Status can allow the programmer to deal with any such problems without the program run stopping and returning to the operating system.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rule searches for Cobol programs using files defined without a FILE-STATUS indicator. Note: Sort files are not considered as violating the rule.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Change the definition of data file in the ENVIRONMENT division and add a FILE-STATUS to the corresponding FD.</p>
<h5>Sample</h5>
<pre>
SELECT TEST-FILE ASSIGN TO &#39;TEST-DATA.DAT&#39;
       ORGANIZATION IS SEQUENTIAL.
...
READ RECORD-IN INTO W-RECORD
...
</pre>
<h5>Remediation sample</h5>
<pre>
SELECT TEST-FILE ASSIGN TO &#39;TEST-DATA.DAT&#39;
       ORGANIZATION IS SEQUENTIAL
       FILE STATUS IS W-STATUS.
...
READ RECORD-IN INTO W-RECORD
IF W-STATUS = &quot;04&quot; THEN
    DISPLAY &quot;Over-sized record has been read&quot;
    SET REC-XS-FLAG TO TRUE
END-IF
</pre>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - The number of violation patterns - Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code: - SELECT ... ASSIGN declaration in the FILE-CONTROL</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of Cobol Programs using Cobol File Links</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7698</p>
