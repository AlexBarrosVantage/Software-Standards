<h4>Avoid direct or indirect remote calls inside a loop</h4>

<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>JEE</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>Yes</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>9</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>All remote calls made inside a loop will badly impact the performances of your application.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Reports the following remote call inside a loop at a depth level less than &lt;depth level&gt;: * SQL Statement through loop (example: SQL cursor on SQL Server, nested cursors on Oracle) * Stored procedure called many times from the client in a loop. * EJB3 Session remote method * ABAP RFC
&lt;depth level&gt; is a parameter that can be changed at will.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>This loop execution can be delegated to the server side of the application so that not network latency will occur.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report all remote call inside a loop. It provides the following information: - Caller Artifact Full Name that contains the loop - path until the remote called artifact Note that: 1/ The call path may contains different path while only one is an error. For example: g(){myException()} f() {
while { g ()} g() } will report both path to g() while only one is a violation. 2/ 2/ Several paths for the same method violating the rule are identified in the Metric Detail page by a sequence ID (in the Value column), this ID is dynamically set during each snapshot and the same path can have a
different sequence ID in different snapshots.</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>All methods calling at least one method inside a loop</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7962</p>
