<h4>Avoid Log forging vulnerabilities ( CWE-117 )</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>C#, JEE</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>Yes</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>8</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Writing unvalidated, unsanitized user input to log files can allow an attacker to forge log entries or inject malicious content into the logs. Applications typically use log files to store a history of events or transactions for later review, statistics gathering, or debugging. Depending on the
nature of the application, the task of reviewing log files may be performed manually or sometimes automated with a tool that automatically gathers log data for important events or trending information. Interpretation of the log files may be hindered or misdirected if an attacker can supply data to
the application that is subsequently logged verbatim.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This metric uses CAST dataflow engine to detect a call path where input data from the user is written into the application logs without prior validation &amp; sanitization. The list of user input methods, Log writing and as well as the validation method can be customized. In Java, the Set
methods of the Form Beans are automatically taken into account as input methods.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Code the appropriate input validation as close as possible to the user input call.</p>
<h5>Reference</h5>
<p>http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>- Method full name - Call stack from user input source down to the target log method</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>The number of methods calling user input methods</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>8044</p>
