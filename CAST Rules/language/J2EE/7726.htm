<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Struts is a Framework for building Model-View-Controller 2 Web applications. This model is the Blueprints recommended architectural design pattern for interactive applications. The logical separation between presentation layer, the business logic layer, and the data access layer is basically an
architectural way to minimize the amount of additional work necessary to add features to any layer that can be consumed by another layer. It separates design concerns (data persistence and behavior, presentation, and control), decreasing code duplication, centralizing control, and making the
application more easily modifiable. MVC 2 also helps developers with different skill sets to focus on their core skills and collaborate through clearly defined interfaces. This is why the data access layer must be distinct from the business layer.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Find all Action Classes (and parent classes) that are referenced in the struts-config.xml through the tag &#39;action-mapping&#39; (in struts 1.x) or in struts.xml and its included files through the tag &#39;action&#39; (in struts 2.x) list artifacts that call classes referenced in a package
that reference directly the database or reference JPA or Hibernate Entities.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Review the design in order to separate the model from the data access layer.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all action artifacts that call a package that reference database or reference JPA or Hibernate Entities. It provides the following information: Artifact full name, the package that reference the database</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>The total number of artifacts of classes and parent classes that are referenced as an action in the XML configuration file(s).</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7726</p>
