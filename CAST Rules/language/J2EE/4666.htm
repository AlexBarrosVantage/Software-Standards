<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>

<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>6</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>There is no dispute that these comments contribute to a developer&#39;s understanding and help a developer write reliable applications more quickly. Without documenting classes and interfaces it is dififcult for anyone else than the author to guess the purpose of the class or interface except by
looking at the code and eventually the code called by the methods in the class.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>When enforcing the utilization of JavaDoc Comments to document an application, all Classes and Interfaces must have JavaDoc Comments. Those comments must be defined just before the declaration of the Class or Interface, with the appropriate structure (/** */)</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all Classes and Interfaces not having JavaDoc comments. This report provides the following information: Class or Interface Full Name</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>classes and interfaces (generic or not)</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
