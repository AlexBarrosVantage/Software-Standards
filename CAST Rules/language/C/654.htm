<h4>Avoid Classes with a High Number Of Children (C++)</h4>

<h5>XXL Status</h5>

<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>

<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>5</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Depth is generally better than breadth in class hierarchy, since it promotes reuse of methods through inheritance. NOC measures the potential influence a Class has on the design. Classes with large number of children require more intensive testing as through inheritance an implementation error
can potentially lead to many regression bugs. Technical or framework classes which are evolving and will not be changed often should not be concerned by this rule.</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Avoid Classes with a High Number Of Children (NOC &gt; X) NOC is the number of immediate &lt;Sub-Classes&gt; of the Class. The threshold is a parameter and can be changed at will.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Review the design of Class hierarchy</p>

<h5>Output</h5>
<p>This report lists all Classes with a Number Of Children (NOC &gt; X) It provides the following information: Class full name, NOC</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>654</p>
