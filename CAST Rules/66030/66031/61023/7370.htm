<h4>Avoid using inline PERFORM with too many lines of code</h4>
<hr>
<h5>Technology</h5>
<p>Cobol</p>
<h5>Unified Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>XXL Status</h5>
<p>N/A</p>
<h5>Critical Quality Rule</h5>
<p>No</p>
<h5>Weight in Parent Tech. Criterion</h5>
<p>6</p>
<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>If the code to be performed is short, an inline PERFORM can be easier to read. But if the code extends over several screens, the logical flow of the program might be clearer if you use an out-of-line PERFORM. (Each paragraph in structured programming should perform one logical function,
however.)</p>
<h5>Description</h5>
<p>This rules searches for Cobol programs containing PERFORM - END-PERFORM loops with more than 80 lines.</p>
<h5>Remediation</h5>
<p>Create a dedicated paragraph and put the lines of code in it. Then change the inline PERFORM to an out-of-line PERFORM.</p>
<h5>Reference</h5>

<h5>Sample</h5>
<pre>
PAR-01.
     ...
     MOVE 0 TO CPT.
     PERFORM UNTIL CPT = 10
* Lines of code on several screens
         ADD 1 TO CPT
     END-PERFORM
     ...
</pre>
<h5>Remediation sample</h5>
<pre>
PAR-01.
     ...
     MOVE 0 TO CPT.
     PERFORM PAR-2 UNTIL CPT = 10.
     ...

 PAR-2.
* Lines of code on several screens
     ADD 1 TO CPT.
</pre>
<h5>Output</h5>
<p>Associated to each COBOL Program with violations, the Quality Rule provides: - The number of violation patterns - Bookmarks for violation patterns found in source code: - PERFORM - END-PERFORM block with more than 80 lines</p>
<h5>Total</h5>
<p>Number of Cobol Programs</p>
<h5>Metric ID</h5>
<p>7370</p>
