<h5>Rationale</h5>
<p>Public fields are accessible by any other Class, therefore its value can be modified at any time, without control by the Class itself. This goes against the concept of OO Encapsulation.</p>

<h5>Description</h5>
<p>Avoid Classes with a High Public Data Ratio greater than X %. Public Data Ratio is the percentage of public fields among all fields. The threshold is a parameter and can be changed at will.</p>
